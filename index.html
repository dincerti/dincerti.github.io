  <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a health economist and data scientist. My work is inherently interdisciplinary and spans a number of disciplines including economics, epidimiology, biostatistics, medicine, and political science. Areas of current focus include: </p>
                    
  <ul>
  <li>Simulation and mathematical modeling for cost-effectiveness analysis including development of the R package <a href = "https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/">hesim</a></li>
  <li>Development and application of causal inference methods for supplementing randomized and single arm clinical trials with observational data</li>
  <li>Machine learning methods and evaluation metrics for prognostic survival modeling with high dimensional data</li>
</ul>
                    
	<p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my wife, Jennifer, and daughter, Evelyn. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
