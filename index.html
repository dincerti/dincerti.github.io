  <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! My background is in applied microeconomics and statistics, but I like working across disciplines and have collaborated with researchers in many fields including bioinformatics, medicine, statistics, computer science, epidemiology, economics, and political science. Since graduate school, Iâ€™ve worked in the health space, both as a health economist and as a data scientist. I am generally interested in solving real-world problems using fit-for-purpose tools from economics and statistics, developing new methods as necessary, and building software to make implementation more efficient for practitioners. Some areas of current focus include: </p>
                    
  <ul>
  <li>Simulation and mathematical modeling for cost-effectiveness analysis including development of the R package <a href = "https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/">hesim</a></li>
  <li>Generalizing relative treatment effects and absolute outcomes from randomized clinical trials to routine practice </li>
  <li>Financial innovation to enable better access to medical treatments</li>
</ul>
                    
	<p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my wife, Jennifer, and daughter, Evelyn. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
